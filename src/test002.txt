Subject: An invitation to an American Church

Hi Long,
You indicated on your FOCUS Registration card that you were interested in visiting an American church or attending a Bible Study.

This is to invite you to visit a church that meets near PSU called "The Groves". The Groves meets every Sunday at University Place, 310 SW Lincoln St. The service starts at 10:30am and gets out around 12noon. There is singing, a Bible message plus coffee/tea and snacks. There is also an opportunity to get acquainted with both Americans and internationals.

This Sunday, Oct 3, after the service, Pizza will be served to welcome all the students back to campus.

If you don't live on campus, contact me and I'll see if I can find you a ride to a church near your home.


I hope to see you there. If you need a ride, email me or call on my cell phone.
