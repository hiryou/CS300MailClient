Subject: Portland State's October Blood Drive!

Hello Long,

Thank you for your previous commitments to save lives through blood donation.  You have provided an irreplacable gift to those facing life threatening circumstances.

American Red Cross and Portland State University are partnering again on a four day blood drive Monday, October 18th through Thursday, October 21st.  Each day the active hours will be from 11am-4pm. 

Because you are a PSU blood donor you get priority to schedule before we start begging in the park blocks :-)  Below are individual links that will take you to each day's schedule.

Thank you so much for your time and care.
